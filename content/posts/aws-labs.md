* [awslabs/git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets) - Prevents you from committing secrets and credentials into git repositories
* [awslabs/aws-serverless-express](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-express) - Run serverless applications and REST APIs using your existing Node.js application framework, on top of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway
