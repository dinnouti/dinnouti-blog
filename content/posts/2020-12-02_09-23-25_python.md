This post is self-service cheat sheet for Python environment and version management. One of the biggest problem with virtual environment in Python is the multiple tools available and how they play together. Often I see them getting out of sync and not working. The most reliable managing the version with pyenv and use ```python3 -m venv .venv``` to create virtual environments.

# pipenv

Pipenv uses pyenv to install the right Python version

```sh
$ cat Pipfile
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]

[packages]
requests = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"

$ pipenv install
Warning: Python 3.6 was not found on your system...
Would you like us to install latest CPython 3.6 with pyenv? [Y/n]: y
Installing CPython 3.6.2 with pyenv (this may take a few minutes)...
...
```

There is an option in pipenv to install the virtual directory in the project directory instead of home subdirectory. Set the environment variable as:

```bash
export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=true
```

## pyenv

Pyenv is a good tool to manage multiple Python versions in the same machine

```bash
# show local versions
pyenv versions
# list all versions
pyenv install --list
# install a specific version
pyenv install 3.9.0
# attach a version to a local folder, creates a file .python-version
pyenv local 3.9.0
```
