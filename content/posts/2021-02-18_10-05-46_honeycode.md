A collection of scraps and code that I need to reference all the time. [Amazon Honeycode](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-honeycode-build-web-mobile-apps-without-writing-code/), which is available in beta, is a fully managed service that allows customers to quickly build powerful mobile and web applications â€“ with no programming required.

Returns true if the row is found. [IsRef( )](https://honeycodecommunity.aws/t/isref/1127)

```js
=ISREF(FindRow(Tasks, "Tasks[Completed]=%", "Yes"))
```

Condition for conditional styling

```js
=[Status]="Not done"
```

Filter a Column List or Stacked List based on a form field. [Filter( )](https://honeycodecommunity.aws/t/filter/923)

```js
=filter(Table,"Table[status]=$[InputRow]")
```

In the same Honeycode form have a toggle for edit and read-only fields. Note this is **not** secure, just a workaround option
